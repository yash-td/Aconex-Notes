##### Key Factors of Collaboration:

1. Communication
		Effective Communication is what separates successful teams from the bad ones. Having clear instructions from the start and throughout the life of the project delivery is crucial along with being prepared to ask questions instead of assuming
2. Reliability
	  Reliability is about building trust. Without it, you don't have a team, just some people working together. A great team can rely on each other to get their work done, to do what they say they will do. 
3. Responsibility
	  Knowing who is doing what and when is a major success factor on any project.

#### 1.3 How Aconex manages Information

- All information is stored in one place making it easy to access
- The organization controls what information they add on Aconex
- They control who sees that information
- You get to see information that you and your company add along with information sent to you 
   and your company by others on the project. Everyone controls their own information.  
- An organization adds or uploads a new document. At that point, only people in that organisationwho have access to that project can see the new document. They'll need to send it to other  organizations in order for those organizations to have access to it. 
- We refer to this as securely stored, but selectively shared.

### 2. Documents and Mail Overview

#### 2.1 What is a Document?

- Revisions and Versions
	
- Controlled Document:
	- It typically means documents that are stored in a system or on a platform like Aconex and that are used by others.
	- When you initially create a document or file, you'll need to get it to a certain state before others can use it. And that will often involve going through multiple drafts and amendments. When it's ready for use, you add it to the system or platform and make it available for others. And the updates will follow a similar process of amending and review before reissuing a new version. And that's essentially what control documents are.

- What documents to put on Aconex?
	- Any document that is important to the project and project team. If a document is needed in order for someone to do something to get the project finished, then it should be on Aconex.

#### 2.2 Getting Started with the Document Register

![[Pasted image 20231106112927.png]]
Anyone in your organization that is part of the project can see all the documents that your organization has added or has been sent. The exception is confidential documents.

- You upload documents in the documents register, with some key information attached like the description of the document. This makes it easier for everyone to search for the document.

- These fields cannot be switched off

- Other Project Specific Fields

![[Pasted image 20231106113319.png]]

- Can use filters, example: Type: Drawing     Discipline: Electrical 

#### 2.3 What is Mail and Why you should use it instead of email

![[Pasted image 20231106113723.png]]

- It's used as a method to communicate with the project team and within your own team too. 

- It's used to ask questions, provide answers to questions, and to give direction or instruction.

- Let's finish with the key differences of a Aconex mail. Even though it's similar to email, there are a couple of differences worth noting. 

- First, there are no limits in terms of the number of miles, attachment size, or recipients, so no more warnings about your mailbox being full.

- Second, once a mail is sent, it cannot be deleted or altered. And this provides a complete and reliable audit trail of all communications and conversations. 

- And then, finally, Aconex annex ensures delivery of each mail item within the project, and that means no mail is ever lost.

#### 2.4 Getting started with the Mail Register
